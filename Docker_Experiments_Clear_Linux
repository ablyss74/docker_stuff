- Some things are expected...
 1. Docker bundle is already installed
 2. You will run this with sudo or root
    If using sudo just add it to the first line of this example to invoke it.
 3. You're okay having Realtime mode is already set to -1 if when using qjackctl 
    See the https://github.com/ablyss74/docker_stuff/blob/main/qjackctl%20docker%20container.md for details for a how-to.
 4. You're aware and okay having your $HOME director mirrowed to the docker $HOME directory.
 5. You're familiar with terminal shell use and know how to execute a program with the ampersand.

- Useful for running hard to find apps and/or for those that don't work right on your existing system. /// However, if your /system is already broke it probably won't help :-)
