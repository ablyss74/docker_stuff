- Some things are expected...
 1. Docker bundle is already installed
 2. You will run this with sudo or root
    If using sudo just add it to the first line of this example to invoke it.
 3. You're okay having Realtime mode is already set to -1 if when using qjackctl 
    See the https://github.com/ablyss74/docker_stuff/blob/main/qjackctl%20docker%20container.md for details for a how-to.
 4. You're aware and okay having your $HOME director mirrowed to the docker $HOME directory.
 5. You're familiar with terminal shell use and know how to execute a program with the ampersand.
 
 
# Del if necessary to start clean: docker rmi debian:latest --force 

# Create a docker template
echo -e 'FROM debian \nRUN apt update \nRUN apt upgrade -y\nRUN apt install jamin -y\nRUN apt install qjackctl -y' > /tmp/Dockerfile && docker build -t debianjamin < /tmp/Dockerfile -


# Tell the docker to run the apps only
echo -e 'FROM debian \nRUN apt update \nRUN apt upgrade -y\nRUN apt install jamin -y\nCMD ["qjackctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]\nCMD ["jamin", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]' > /tmp/Dockerfile && docker build -t debianjamin < /tmp/Dockerfile -


# Run the program
xhost local:${USER} && docker run -it --privileged -v ${HOME}:/root -e JACK_NO_AUDIO_RESERVATION=1  --device /dev/snd -e PULSE_SERVER=unix:${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/pulse/native -v ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/pulse/native:${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/pulse/native -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm:rw --net=host -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} debianjamin
