### Basically this is a short one liner to build and execute ubuntu:latest docker in clear linux.

- It assumes the following...
 1. Docker bundle is already installed
 2. You will run this with sudo or root
 3. Realtime mode is already set to -1 /// if not see the https://github.com/ablyss74/docker_stuff/blob/main/qjackctl%20docker%20container.md page for details how.
 4. You're aware and okay having your $HOME director mirrowed to the docker $HOME directory

- Useful for running hard to find apps and/or for those that don't work right on your existing system. /// However, if your /system is already broke it probably won't help :-)
