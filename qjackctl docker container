# What this does... 
# 1. Build a docker container that will we be working with from the command prompt.
# 2. Execute a few commands on the host so we can display GUI apps and run qjackctl in realtime


# First step we need to set realtime sched on the host machine
# 1. Open your favorite terminal and type: sudo bash
# 2. Once root is logged in, type: echo "-1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
# 3. Next type: exit
# 3. The default value on my OS is 950000 and defaults to that value on every reboot.



# Second step - will need to set xhost to accept connections from the docker container
# 1. type this into terminal: xhost local:${USER}



# Third step we need to pull a docker image.  If you haven't alrady installed docker do that now by following the instructions provided by your OS
# 1. sudo docker pull ubuntu


# Fourth step is to run the docker container and work with it from the command line
# 1. type: sudo docker run -it --privileged -e JACK_NO_AUDIO_RESERVATION=1 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm:rw --net=host -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} ubuntu

# Fifth step - Once logged in to the container we need to update and install some stuff
# 1. type: apt update && apt upgrade -y
# 2. type: apt install qjackctl -y
# 3. type: qjackctl &
