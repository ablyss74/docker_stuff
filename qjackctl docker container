# What this does... 
# 1. Build a docker container from the command prompt and run qjackctl in realtime.
# There are known issues that I haven't resolved and will discuss more about that below.


# Set realtime sched on the host machine
# 1. sudo bash
# 2. echo "-1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
# 3. exit
# The default value on my OS is 950000 and defaults to that value on every reboot.


# Set xhost to accept connections from the docker container
# 1. xhost local:${USER}

# Load module snd_seq
# 1. sudo modprobe snd_seq


# Pull docker image.  If you haven't alrady installed docker do that now by following the instructions provided by your OS
# 1. sudo docker pull ubuntu


# Run docker container and work with it from the command line
# 1. sudo docker run -it --privileged -e JACK_NO_AUDIO_RESERVATION=1 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm:rw --net=host -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} ubuntu

# Update and install some stuff from within the docker container
# 1. apt update && apt upgrade -y
# 2. apt install qjackctl -y
#  During the install you will be prompted to enter the geographic location and keyboard layout. 
#  You will also be prompted to enable realtime priority: select yes
# 5. qjackctl
# Do not exit without saving container.. see next step

# Save the docker container - So we do not have to repeat all the steps again we need to save the docker container
# 1. sudo docker ps
# 2. sudo docker commit <CONTAINER ID>  <IMAGE>  # Replace Container ID and Image with what is shown after your type docker ps

# Delete docker contianer - For whatever reason
# 1. sudo docker rmi ubuntu --force


# Known Issues
# jackctl will freeze up w/ various panels and other apps via apt
# For example apt install obs-studio or apt install lxpanel will freeze up qjackctl
# To work around this do not install them via apt and build from source, or use another GUI app instead of qjackctl
# If qjackctl freeze up the container press <alt><control-key><F3>, log in and killall qjackctl than <alt><control-key><F1> to return
