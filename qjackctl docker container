# What this does... 
# Build a docker container from the command prompt and run qjackctl in realtime.


# Set realtime sched on the host machine
# The default value on my OS "Clear Linux" is 950000 and defaults to that value on every reboot.
# Be sure to not copy/paste both lines at once, but instead both separately. 
sudo bash # Copy this line first
echo "-1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us && exit  ## Copy this next


# Set xhost to accept connections from the docker container
xhost local:${USER}

# Load module snd_seq 
sudo modprobe snd_seq


# Pull docker image.  If you haven't already installed docker do that now by following the instructions provided by your OS

# After qjackctl starts, open the settings and tell which audio card to use, else it won't start.

# Save your container image as described above.

# Extra stuff you can add to the container are cairo-dock, ardour, obs-studo, nvidia drive, google-chrome.

# Known bugs:
# Some apps do not render correctly in enlightenment desktop e.g., obs-studio, but work fine in gnome or xfce4.
# Docker pulled with ubuntu might break qjackctl with certain apps and dependencies. Pulling debian instead fixes this which is the default.
