### Basically this is a short one liner to build and execute ubuntu:latest docker in clear linux.

- It assumes the the docker bundle is already installed

Also assumes you will run this with with sudo or root

And also assumes realtime mode is already set to -1 /// if not see the [qjackctl docker](https://github.com/ablyss74/docker_stuff/blob/main/qjackctl%20docker%20container.md) page for details how.

Useful for running hard to find apps and/or those that don't work right on your existing system
